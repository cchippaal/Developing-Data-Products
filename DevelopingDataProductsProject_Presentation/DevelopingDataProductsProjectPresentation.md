## ShinyApp Pitch for ggplot2 Demo

## Shiny App ggplot2 Demo Description

- Minimum stengths of `ggplot` not widely known
- Non-intuitive syntax of `ggplot` R commands
- Optional features such as `colour` and `facet_wrap` mysterious to many

## Who will helpful this ShinyApp?

- Power Users to see the power and flexibility of `ggplot`
- Demonistrate to others how to use `ggplot` with examples
- Wishing to review the power of the `eval` command
- Who wants to use the `ggplot` but was hesitant to make the leap

```r
ggplot_command = sprintf("g = ggplot(mpg, aes(x=%s, y=%s, colour=%s)) + facet_wrap(~%s) + geom_%s()",
                             input$x, input$y, input$colour, input$facet_wrap, input$geom)
    eval(parse(text=ggplot_command))
```

# Sample Command and Plot Generated by the ShinyApp ggplot2 Demo


```r
g = ggplot(mpg, aes(x=cyl, y=hwy, colour=class)) + facet_wrap(~drv) + geom_point()
```
